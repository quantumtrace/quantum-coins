# Quantum Coins - A Quantum Random Number Generator
A Qiskit implementation of a quantum random number generator execued by a real IBM quantum device (quantum_coins.py).

You can also see how the original circuit is transpiled to be executed on the ibmq_belem device (quantum_coins_ibmq_belem.py and circuit_ibmq_belem.png).
